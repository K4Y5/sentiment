This package performs simple sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. It loads data into memory so no database is required. It can import and export corpus data and allows training.

Various word lists have been used to train the classifier, including some from http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
